## Typing with ChatGPT

This is a web application project I've wanted to create for a while.
The idea is to create a typing game to practice touch typing, where ChatGPT plays the role of creating the text for the user to type.
Some of my inspiration for this page goes to [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/). I've always been a fan of their simplistic and pretty style, not to mention the amount of theme options.
